CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:3 (cmake_policy):
  The OLD behavior for policy CMP0074 will be removed from a future version
  of CMake.

  The cmake-policies(7) manual explains that the OLD behaviors of all
  policies are deprecated and that a policy should be set to OLD only under
  specific short-term circumstances.  Projects should be ported to the NEW
  behavior and not rely on setting a policy to OLD.


CMake Warning (dev) at CMakeLists.txt:5 (set):
  implicitly converting 'TYPE' to 'STRING' type.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.

CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:22 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findflann.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project has
  asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by "flann", but
  CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "flann" with any of
  the following names:

    flannConfig.cmake
    flann-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "flann" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "flann_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "flann"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
